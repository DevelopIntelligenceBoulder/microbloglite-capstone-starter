# Interesting pieces of code
Armanie 
I found this code interesting because at first I was trying to redirect the page if the status was === 200 but when looking further it would be 201 or even 399 so then with jonathans help we realized you could just do the res.ok to make it redirect as long as it was a working status code

# Acknowledge
