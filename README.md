# Interesting Code

### Aviad

*"I found this if statement very interesting to me because I didn't know how to use the .ok Response property. It basically returns a boolean if the response was accepted or successful."*
```
if (response.ok) {
        window.location.href = "../index.html";
    }
```

### Jeanette

*"I found the most interesting because it uses a ternary operator to conditionally render the delete button only if the user is logged in and if its their post so that the user cannot delete other users posts."*
```
${post.username === loginData.username ? 
```

### Tina

*"An interesting code for me was enforcing the max character lengths. Using JS to check the length and making sure it doesn't passed the MAXlength that I created. If criteria is within this length, then the Post will be created.. That was the interesting piece of code that I brainstormed, googled and learned."*

```
function isArticleLengthValid() {
    const title = blogTitleField.value;
    const article = articleField.value;
    const maxArticleLength = 200;
    const maxTitleLength = 50;
    return title.length <= maxTitleLength && article.length <= maxArticleLength;
}
```
