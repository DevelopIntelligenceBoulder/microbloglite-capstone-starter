- We met up at a boba tea shop to better progress in our work.
- Minor issues fixed : landing page, authentication key and so on
- Did i have trouble with the post Yes, is it resolved.... No 
- I know that my issue lies with how i call out the api in the fetch request and node also seems to be bugging out here 
and there so my only hope was(shes going on for ages)
