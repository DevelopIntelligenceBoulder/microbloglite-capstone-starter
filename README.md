# CAPSTONE-3-OUTDOORS


Hello and welcome to my website for MicroblogLite API

This is a simple example website with basic user functions

There are 6 file directories in the Capstone which all link to their own index.html, .js, and .css files


The Nav Bar links each page within the website to each other and it is a sticky bar, so when you scroll it will move with the browser 

Footer shows simple information about the company

Main section houses the content for each webpage

There are 5 web pages

Landing Page - Login
Registration - Register
Home Page 
Profile Page
Posts Page

Login page is where users can log into the Blog Site and access all the features. 
Invalid usernames and password will not work
Gives the user the option to go to the Registration page

Registration page is where users can create an account to use the website and microblog API
Invalid inputs will not work

Profile page is where users can view, create, delete, or edit their posts and make an About Me bio for their account

Posts page is where users can see all the posts created by all the users in the microblog API


Each webpage has responsive web design and it will resize to fit all the contents evenly within the viewort
