- Team meetup at 10am in class, got help from Justin and Pastor E with the project.
- UGHH, I thought the edit feature was required and worked on it for an hour it sucks.
- My progress today: 
1. Got the Logout feature to work.
2. Successfully load profile information e.g. full name, username and bio description.
3. Starting on creating post and POST the request to the api but it got too late and past my bedtime.

GOOD NIGHT! - Buttercup

Wednesday 12.07.2022 Log(from Blossom:
- We met up at a boba tea shop to better progress in our work.
- Minor issues fixed : landing page, authentication key and so on
- Did i have trouble with the post Yes, is it resolved.... No 
- I know that my issue lies with how i call out the api in the fetch request and node also seems to be bugging out here 
and there so my only hope was(shes going on for ages)
