# MEDITERRANEAN FOOD BLOG 

## Overview

As Webweavers we were challenged to create a website that allowed users to create an account with The Mediterranean Bowl webpage,
log in when needed and write a post with their contribution e.g. recipe on grandmas Paella from Spain. 
This post would then be stored in the server to then be displayed for multiple users to see. 

## Features

- * Featuring 4 different HTML pages (landing.html, registration.html, post.html, )
- * Utilizing APIs to fetch data.
- * The avalability to sign up, log in and post for a user.
