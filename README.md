- Team meetup at 10am in class, got help from Justin and Pastor E with the project.
- UGHH, I thought the edit feature was required and worked on it for an hour it sucks.
- My progress today: 
1. Got the Logout feature to work.
2. Successfully load profile information e.g. full name, username and bio description.
3. Starting on creating post and POST the request to the api but it got too late and past my bedtime.

GOOD NIGHT! - Buttercup
