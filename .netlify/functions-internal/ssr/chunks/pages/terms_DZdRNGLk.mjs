Terms and Conditions
</h3> <p>
Welcome to <a href="../registration/" class="text-primary">CodeSwitch!</a>
By entering this zone of endless coding jokes and developer memes,
						you hereby agree to embark on a journey of binary humor and
						coffee-fueled discussions.
</p> <p></p><h6>User Responsibilities:</h6> You are responsible for the wit and charm
						you bring to the community. Lame jokes are strictly prohibited; violators
						will be sentenced to a lifetime of debugging legacy code.
 <p></p><h6>Intellectual Property:</h6> All your witty one-liners and clever
						code snippets belong to you, but don't be surprised if someone decides
						to use them. This is a playground for sharing, after all.
 <p></p><h6>Community Etiquette:</h6> Treat others as you want to be treated.
						Remember, every semicolon is sacred, and every curly brace has feelings.
						No cyber-bullying or shaming fellow devs for their choice of programming
						language. Code of Conduct:
 <p></p><h6>Code of Conduct:</h6> Thou shalt not steal someone else's code without
						proper attribution. Kata points will be deducted , and your console will
						be haunted by infinite loops.
 <p></p><h6>Termination of Account:</h6> Accounts may be terminated for excessive
						use of "goto" statements or for attempting to fix bugs by sacrificing
						rubber chickens. Be reasonable, people.
 </div> <div class="container text-center mx-auto"> <h3 class="display-4 m-0 py-0 mb-3 text-primary">Privacy Policy</h3> <p></p><h6>Data Collection:</h6>
We collect data on your favorite programming languages, preferred
						text editors, and the number of rubber ducks in your coding space.
						This information is purely for statistical purposes and occasional
						laughs.
 <p></p><h6>Cookies:</h6>
Cookies are not just for breakfast. Ours are used to improve your user
						experience, not for secret midnight snacking. Please enjoy responsibly.
<p></p><h6>Third-Party Integrations:</h6>
We integrate with third-party platforms only to enhance your coding
							adventures. Rest assured, your code snippets are safe from any unauthorized
							refactoring.
 <p></p><h6>Security Measures:</h6>
We guard your data with the same level of intensity a developer guards
							their caffeine stash during a hackathon. However, we cannot guarantee
							the safety of your code from the occasional coffee spill.
 <p></p><h6>Notifications:</h6>
Expect notifications about new followers, witty comments, and the occasional
							reminder to stand up, stretch, and blink. Your well-being is our concern,
							even if your code does not have bugs.
